Day 14 Python Project Courses by Angela Wu: Higher Low Game

The project was to make a higher low game without any hint/clue, we have to do it from scratch 

The first thing, I've done was to make a flowchart on paper and pseudo code
Then I cut the big problems into smaller one and code it step by step 
I have use print a lot to prevent bugs 

With this method, I've been able to make this project, i'm pretty happy with it, because at first i was little worried by the data and to switch the celebrity b into a, but it comes naturally when i was writing code following my pseudo code.

If you have any advice or comment, feel free to tell me, thank you
Special thanks to Angela Wu who made a great course 

My project is in main.py
